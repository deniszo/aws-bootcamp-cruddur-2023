### Considerations when asking for help

To be mindful of everyone's time and to make sure you've given some time and thought to overcome the problem on your own, when asking for help give:

- the context of an error (what the problem is, what actions caused it, what was the outcome of the actions)
- screenshots, if given, should be precise and provide as much of info as needed, not more no less
- if possible/applicable share your research/assumptions on the issue
- when sharing the code do it with the appropriate formatting and highilghting, also try to reduce the amount of code and try to pinpoint the exact place you think has the problem in it. If unsure also provide a link to the whole file/repo
- make sure to check the devtools console, network tab for any failing requests, for memory/perf related cases it's beninficial to run some profiling. Share those findings

### Grading Homework Summaries

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKAScachFgk&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=26)

Good:

- consice
- has details - names of tools, services, costs, etc.
- challenges and mistakes
- when describing required checklist item, details of how it was accomplished instead of simply copying the result description

Bad:

- simply repeating the checklist description
- no summary at all or just a link to journal
- too big (more than a paragraph, 2 tops)
- too much unrelated info

### Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJnNe5Nv4tE&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=23)

Containers provide reproducibility, portability, isolation, simplification and seed up of development and testing and predictability when deploying to prod.

Instead of building the software yourself on your machine (or on different machines if you need it) you can rely on a huge number of public images built and tested by the community.

https://www.linuxserver.io is a group that maintains lots of different images.

The images are usually hosted on container-registries and one of the most popular ones is [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/). There are a number of other registries that could be used.
Also there is an OCI (Open Container Initiative) which standardizes how the images, registries are built, etc. and Dockerhub follows the OCI standard.

The images are **_pushed_** into the registry, from where the consumers **_pull_** them.

A Dockerfile (no extension is due to unknown historic reasons) defines the container:

```dockerfile
# backend-flask/Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

# Inside Container
WORKDIR /backend-flask

# Outside -> Inside
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

# Inside
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Outside -> Inside
COPY . .

# Inside
ENV FLASK_ENV=development

# Inside -> Outside
EXPOSE ${PORT}

CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
```

Instructions are pretty much self-explanatory but just in case:

- `FROM <image-name>` - describes the base image for the container. There are _slim_ versions with most of the unused stuff stripped off and normal versions that might include extra stuff like `curl`, etc. In the example [`python:3.10-slim-buster` base image](https://github.com/docker-library/python/blob/a3533b1c48d968e784516470d18f3c24975df3d8/3.10/slim-buster/Dockerfile) is used (which uses [`debian:buster-slim` underneath](https://github.com/debuerreotype/docker-debian-artifacts/blob/48072f1bd234114bb51470bba31a4e4a0040a2a4/buster/slim/Dockerfile) which in trun is based off `scratch`). To see what is really installed in container one would need to go all the way down through to the root container

> `scratch` is an official "empty" image and can be even found [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch). According to the description: "`FROM scratch` is a no-op in the Dockerfile, and will not create an extra layer in your image".

- `WORKDIR` - sets the directory from which the application will work from when the container starts. That directory is within the Container and **not** connected to any directory of the Host OS. ![](assets/docker-guest-host.png)

- `COPY` - copies particular files (or all of them with `COPY . .`) from the current directory on Host OS to the working directory in Container

- `RUN` - runs a command within the container

- `ENV` - sets an environment variable

- `EXPOSE` -

- `CMD` - is used to run the application. The arguments should be provided as an array of strings, so the following bash command to [run backend locally](../backend-flask/README.md#L44):
  ```bash
  python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
  ```
  would translate into `["python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]`

> `RUN` vs `CMD`. `RUN` is used to create a **layer**, eg. install something into the container. `CMD` is the command that will run when the container starts and it doesn't create a layer

When running backend opening http://127.0.0.1:4567/api/activities/home should show something like this:
![](./assets/backend-running-demo.png)

Command to build a container:

```bash
docker build -t backend-flask ./backend-flask
```

`-t` flag allows to _tag_ the container as "backend-flask". Here is the [list of options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#options) for `docker-build` command

The output:

To run it:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' [-d] backend-flask
```

`-d` can be used to run in "detached" mode

To debug a running container one could

- either use "Attach shell" in VS Code ![](./assets/vs-code-attach-shell.png)
- or connect via bash:

  ```bash
  $ docker ps # to list all running containers
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES

  $ docker exec -it c743fc4bf21c bash # execute shell on the container
  ```

To list all images:

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY            TAG         IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE

> While virtualization provides true isolation and independent resources managed by Hypervisor, containerization achieves similar goals by sharing the Host OS resources via the Container Daemon: ![](./assets/virtualization-vs-containers.png)

Containerizing frontend:

```dockerfile
# frontend-react-js/Dockerfile
FROM node:16.18

ENV PORT=3000

COPY . /frontend-react-js
WORKDIR /frontend-react-js
RUN npm install
EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Build Container:

```bash
docker build -t frontend-react-js ./frontend-react-js
```

Run Container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d -e REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL='localhost:4567' frontend-react-js
```

After adapting `docker-compose.yaml` to run locally, it's alive:
